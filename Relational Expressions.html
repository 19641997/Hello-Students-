<h2><p>Example 1. Which of the following algebraic expresstions are polynomials?</p></h2>
<h2><blockquote> i.&nbspx<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 3  &nbsp &nbsp ii.&nbsp<t>x<sup>2</sup> + 2&#8730x</h2>
<h2> Solutions:</h2>
<h2><blockquote><p> i.&nbsp x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 3 is a polynomial, since the power of x in each term is a <br>&nbsp &nbsp non-negative integer.</p></h2>
<h2><blockquote><p>ii.&nbsp x<sup>2</sup> + 2&#8730x is not  a polynomial, since the power of x in second term <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2&#8730x is 1/2 which is a fraction and not a non-negative integer.</p></h2>
